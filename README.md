# Basic Node.js app with Typescript

This boilerplate was created for the blog post [How to create a Node.js App with TypeScript?](https://blog.alexanderwolf.tech/how-to-create-a-node-js-app-with-typescript)

## The setup contains

- Typescript configuration for a Node.js app
- Node dev. setup with source file watching
- Prettier for formatting your code
- TSlint for linting
- Jest for unit testing

## Usage

1. Clone the repo. to a folder name of your choice
2. Remove .git folder (to remove git history)
3. Run `git init` and add your new remote
4. `yarn start` and start coding by modifying `./src/index.ts`

## Possible improvements to the boilerplate

- Add Husky and Pretty-quick to run Prettier as pre-commit hook
- Add a basic Node.js app as an example instead of the `console.log`
- Use that example for an unit test
